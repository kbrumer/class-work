# Class 10 Lecture: Stacks and Queues

* Review whiteboard skills
   * mind-map
   * grading rubric (again)

* Data structures
   * Abstract data type
   * Restricting the interface
   * Hiding information
   * Stacks
       * First on, last off
       * Push, pop, peek
   * Queues
       * First on, first off
       * Enqueue, dequeue, hasNext

## Lecture
- Review arrays briefly as data structures
- Introduce Stack and explain, do a simple live code example. Maybe do a Stack class
- Review whiteboard material: mindmap lays out “steps”, rubric lays out “skills”
- Have students pair up and choose someone to go first and do first problem
- It will probably take them 30-45 minutes to get through exercise. You may need to call out 5 minutes left at 40 minutes
- Debrief. If better solution exists, you can code it out for them how you would do it.
- Introduce Queue and explain, do simple live code example.
- Have pair switch and other students does second problem
- After 45 min, get back together and debrief and possibly show them how if needed
- Review key points of day’s topics

## Whiteboard Problems

There are two “ready-made” whiteboard problems:

* write a function for determining if a string has matching parentheses

* write a function to determine if a string is a palindrome
